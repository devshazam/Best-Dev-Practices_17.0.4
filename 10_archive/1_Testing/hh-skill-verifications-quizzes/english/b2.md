#### Q11. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. What is true about dead zones?

```
A British tourist has been attacked by a shark off the coast of Texas, making it the eighth
shark attack in the USA this year. We now go over life to freeport for a special report
from our North American correspondent, Andrew Evans. Andrew, I understand the man didn't
do anything unusual to cause this attack.
Yes, that's right Beverly. Mark Skipper, a 47-year-old man from Oxford, was just swimming on his
own quite close to the beach when he was attacked.
How badly was he hurt? Well, we don't have much information yet, but we know his leg
was bitten quite badly. He was immediately taken to hospital and we're waiting to hear
how he is. So Andrew, why are the sharks coming in so close?
Well, Ryan Williamson, who works for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, believes
that the increase in shark attacks is because of what they call dead zones. These are areas
in the ocean where there isn't enough oxygen, so all the fish die.
So there aren't any fish for the sharks to eat?
Exactly. Many of these dead zones are actually quite close to the coast, so the sharks come
in closer and closer looking for food.
So what turns an area of the ocean into a dead zone?
I'm afraid it's us, Beverly, people. There's too much pollution in the sea and it's killing
all the fish. And these dead zones cover fairly large areas, the one we're talking about here,
for example, covers about 5,800 square miles.
And are these dead zones only around the US coast?
No, they're not. According to the United Nations, there are about 150 dead zones around
the world. That's twice as many as there were 15 years ago. The largest ones are in
the oceans and seas around China, Japan, South America, Australia and New Zealand. And the
number of shark attacks has increased in all of those places.
So is the Wildlife Department in Texas now saying that people shouldn't go swimming?
So they aren't telling people to stay out of the water, but they've advised holiday
makers not to go swimming early in the morning or in the evening because those are the times
when sharks feed.
Thank you, Andrew Evans, for that report.

#### Q12. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. What makes Paola sad?

```
Hi I'm Paola I am Italian but I grew up in South Africa. I was born in Zimbabwe
and then my parents moved to South Africa and then subsequently when I was
21 I moved to Italy and have spent most of my adult life living in Italy and now
in the UK. I've got a very strange relationship with my accent because I
think that I speak proper English and I sound like an Englishman but as soon as
I open my mouth people immediately ask me the question where are you from which
always throws me a bit because I really don't know how to answer that question.
Growing up in South Africa I was always referred to as the Italian stallion
probably because my parents were Italian and because my name is Italian. As soon as
I moved to Italy when I was 21 and they heard me open my mouth and speak Italian
with an English accent they used to call me the English girl because Italian is
really going to distinguish between English or British English or American
English or English from any other English speaking world countries so I was
always the English girl and then about seven years ago I came to the UK and I
thought I'd fit in perfectly because I grew up in the British colony and I
thought I was you know had some kind of affinity was England and as soon as I
open my mouth once again people said to me where are you from and I would say
I'm Italian and they would say oh so then why do you speak with the South
African accent and that really upsets me because my cultural identity and my
upbringing my heritage is Italian and I feel that because I live for protected
period of time in South Africa that I have somehow gotten an accent that
doesn't fit my personality or who I think I am.
```

#### Q13. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. What advantages does this man’s Australian accent give him?

```
I didn't really think about my accent until I left Australia and came to England and it
was strange I suppose probably the reaction it got from people is people assumed that
I was very laid back, very sort of easy going kind of guy, which was great in terms of meeting
friends, you know, people want to sort of go for a drink and thought I'd be a good laugh.
In terms of getting jobs and things that could be a bit of a disadvantage I suppose because
people thought that, you know, maybe I wouldn't take it seriously or that, yeah, maybe just
a bit too laid back for their work I suppose. The honest thing though I think was that the
English seemed to have an assumption because I had an Australian accent I must be really
good at sport and I particularly cricket which is a very strange thing, there was one guy
who actually literally asked me to be in his team purely because of the way that I spoke.
Now I am absolutely terrible at cricket so anyway I turned up, played the game, was complete
disaster, was out for a duck and yeah it didn't ask me back so that was that. But yeah
so but it's been good overall I think, yeah it comes across well I think.

#### Q14. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. You are going to hear four people who have migrated talking about their experiences. Which speaker encountered some negative attitudes at the beginning?

```
I've been here now for about 15 years.
It's a good life, though I work hard, but frankly I miss my country and the town where I grew up and dream of going back.
I feel special ties to the place, and when I retire I hope to return there to be among my friends and my family.
Two.
We were utterly fed up with the crime and feeling of insecurity that surrounded us, and it was precisely for that reason that we moved away.
What really worried us was the effect it might have on the kids going to the local school.
We felt it just wasn't worth the risk.
On the other hand, it hasn't been easy coping with the language barrier, I have to admit.
At least not for us parents.
The kids integrated straight away, of course.
Three.
I haven't changed countries, but I've moved from the country to the city because it has better services and more opportunities.
I was absolutely astonished to find that many people looked down on me when I first arrived, which didn't exactly make things easy.
I suppose they thought, oh here's some country bumpkin come to the city to make good, and I guess they were right because I have.
Four.
I love lots of things about my country.
The food, the sense of humour, the newspapers, lots of things.
Actually, I have to admit it was the climate I couldn't stand any longer.
I just found the short grey days and the continual rain totally depressing.
Mind you, the heat sometimes is a problem here and then I dream of going home.
But that's only the old day here and there.
Mostly it's fine.

#### Q15. Listen to the text and choose the right answer. What accent does this woman say she has?

```
I've moved so many times I sort of hardly know what my accent is now.
Before I was 18 I'd moved 12 times.
I started out in New England and ended up in the Rocky Mountains and I've spent over
half my life here in England.
So I never really got a chance to settle into any particular accent.
I suppose I'd call my accent now mid-Atlantic.
But what's happened to me is that I've ended up not really being from anywhere.
So when I go to the States they think I'm Irish for some reason.
And when I am here obviously they know I'm from America but they sort of don't notice.
So I can fit in or not fit in depending on the circumstances.
But I'm somewhere in the middle of the ocean.
And I suppose I'm happy to be there but I have to know who I am and myself because
people don't really recognize me as being from anywhere.
